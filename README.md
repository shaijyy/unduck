DuckDuckGo's bang redirects are too slow. We fix them.  
Add the following URL as a custom search engine to your browser.  
Enables all of DuckDuckGo's bangs to work, but much faster.  
```
https://unduck-phi.vercel.app?q=%s
```
## [Quacky](https://quacky-gamma.vercel.app) v2!
Scrapes DuckDuckGo for the first result then redirect the user.  
That simple.  
Nothing personalized or sponsored. Pure Luck. (APIs)  

**Whats new in v2?**
 - Complete Rewrite to decrease chances of ratelimiting and other stuff.
 - Added support to multiple bases (html and lite versions of DuckDuckGo)
 - Better error handling and more detailed error messages.

**What's to come in v3?**
 - Better user interface
 - More instances (to decrease chances of ratelimiting)

## How is this any better than DuckDuckGo or the original Unduck?

Couple of reasons:
 - Faster ⚡
 - Looks better 💄
 - Choose a default bang (Enables default search for over 13,000 websites) 🙌
 - Animations (Because it's Animations.) 📺
 - 0 Analytics. No data collected. 📅
 - i- it- it- its just better. pliz use 🥲
