DuckDuckGo's bang redirects are too slow. We fix them.  
Add the following URL as a custom search engine to your browser.  
Enables all of DuckDuckGo's bangs to work, but much faster.

```
## [Quacky!](https://github.com/shaijyy/quacky-worker) v3!
Scrapes DuckDuckGo for the first result then redirect the user.  
It is that simple.  
Not Sponsored and not targeted.  

**Whats new in v3?**  
 - Redid everything from Scratch - now with a main instance that gives commands to an amount of workers.  
   This means faster results and so much less blockage and rate limiting.  
 - Added Cache Support - if someone already searched the exact term you do, why check it again every time?  
 - A free self-hostable solution of Quacky! - Check it out [here](https://github.com/shaijyy/quacky-worker)!  

**How do I use it tho?**  
You can use the old !Unduck !Bang,  
or even DuckDuckGo's Syntax by adding a space followed by an "!" in your search query.    

**What's to come in the future?**
 - A brand new interface to work with Quacky,
 - QuackSquad - Host us an instance we can use and get cool perks! Free for you and for us.  
 - Support for Bing and KARMA under anonymous settings

## How is this any better than DuckDuckGo or the original Unduck?

Couple of reasons:
 - Faster ⚡
 - Looks better 💄
 - Choose a default bang (Enables default search for over 13,000 websites) 🙌
 - Animations (Because it's Animations.) 📺
 - 0 Analytics. No data collected. 📅
 - i- it- it- its just better. pliz use 🥲

## We care about you. Those big companies don't.
